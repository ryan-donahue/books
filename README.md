This is a list of the books that I have read. This list is starting Wednesday
August 12, 2015. Any books that I have read prior to starting this list will
have a date of 1999-01-01.

While I have thought about some way of recording the books that I have read,
the impedus and implementation is from [Jack Baty's] post [My reading list as a
text file]
